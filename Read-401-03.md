## Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
1.integrate and update data 
2.authentication
3.Handling error.
## True or false: The route handler is middleware?
false

## In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

by adding next() at the end of the middleware or just end it with WRRC

## At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

after request before response 

## What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

The error "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent." means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written. For example, look for callbacks that are accidentally called twice, or any error that happens after the body is sent.
 
## Terms Documentation

#### Middleware: is a function that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the express server to modify the req and res objects. Middlewares have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.

#### Request Object: an object that represents the http request. It has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. source (Links to an external site.)

#### Response Object: an obkect that specifies the http response which is sent by the express server app when it gets an http request. source (Links to an external site.)

#### Application Middleware: a middleware that is bound to the instance of the app object with app.use ot app.method

#### Routing Middleware: a middleware that is bound to an instance of express.Router()

#### Test Driven Development: software development process that relays on testing the software requirements against all test cases.

#### Behavioral Testing: testing the external behavior of the program, also known as black box testing
