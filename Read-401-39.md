## MobX

The core idea
State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those.

MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

Conceptually MobX treats your application like a spreadsheet.



First of all, there is the application state. Graphs of objects, arrays, primitives, references that forms the model of your application. These values are the “data cells” of your application.
Secondly there are derivations. Basically, any value that can be computed automatically from the state of your application. These derivations, or computed values, can range from simple values, like the number of unfinished todos, to complex stuff like a visual HTML representation of your todos. In spreadsheet terms: these are the formulas and charts of your application.
Reactions are very similar to derivations. The main difference is these functions don't produce a value. Instead, they run automatically to perform some task. Usually this is I/O related. They make sure that the DOM is updated or that network requests are made automatically at the right time.
Finally there are actions. Actions are all the things that alter the state. MobX will make sure that all changes to the application state caused by your actions are automatically processed by all derivations and reactions. Synchronously and glitch-free.




## Review, Research, and Discussion


### What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

Best practice would be to fire off an api call from a useEffect() call on pageload. Because this is asynchronous, this will require Thunk middleware. You may then use mapStateToProps() to assign the returned data to props which can be passed to the component in question.


### When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

The most common use case for Redux Thunk is for communicating asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data. Redux Thunk makes it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**middleware:** It is a code that runs between two functions, in the case of redux, code that is wrapped between our createStore() function and our connect() function.

**thunk:** It is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
