## How to Solve Programming Problems

#### Common mistakes

When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.

If you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.

The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

#### A simple set of steps

I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1.Read the problem completely twice.
2.Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3.Optimize the manual steps.
4.Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5.Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6.Optimize the real code.

#### Optimize the manual solution

People often doon’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

Let’s look at our string reversal example and see if we can simplify the steps.

We should be able to immediately recognize that we can use a loop here to reduce the manual steps.  Our duplicate why’s for most of our steps tell us that we are doing the same thing over and over for each step, just with different data.

Write “Zebra” down.
Start at the last letter in the word and create a new empty word.
Append the current letter to the new word
If there is a previous letter, make the previous letter the current letter and start back at 3.
Look how close we are getting to code at this point.  You should be tempted to actually write the code for this.  That is good, it tells you that you have solved and simplified the problem well.  Writing code should now become very easy.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

#### How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?

* Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
What would your life look like?
* What people would you stop putting up with?
* What problems would you stop wasting time on?
* What things would you stop — and start — doing?
* Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

#### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

You probably need to say “no” more.
Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.

## The 5 Whys

#### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

#### How to Use the 5 Whys

1.Assemble a Team
2.Define the Problem
3.Ask the First “Why?”
4.Ask “Why?” Four More Times
5.Know When to Stop
6.Address the Root Cause(s)
7.Monitor Your Measures
