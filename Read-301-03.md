# How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript

The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

## What is the spread operator?

InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
“When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.” — JavaScript.info
The spread operator was added to JavaScript in ES6 (ES2015), just like the rest parameters, which have the same syntax: three magic dots ….

## What is ... used for?


“Spread operator to the rescue! It looks similar to rest parameters, also using ..., but does quite the opposite.” — JavaScript.info
Take trying to find the largest number in an array with Math.max():

## What else can … do?


The … spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:
Copying an array
Concatenating or combining arrays
Using Math functions
Using an array as arguments
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React
Combining objects
Converting NodeList to an array
In each case, the spread syntax expands an iterable object, usually an array, though it can be used on any interable, including a string.

## Examples of using …


Here are a couple basic examples of using … in JavaScript, where I demonstrate copying an array, splitting a string into characters, and combining the properties of two JavaScript objects:

## Copying an array

Using the … spread operator is a convenient way to copy an array or combine arrays, and it can even add new items:

## Concatenating arrays

Asseen in the last example, the spread operator can quickly combine two arrays, an operation known as array concatenation

## Using Math functions


“The Math object's set of functions are a perfect example of the spread operator as the only argument to a function.” — @davidwalshblog on his blog
One of the best ways to understand the use of spread operator in JavaScript is to look at the the built-in functions Math.min() and Math.max(), which both expect a list of arguments, not an array.

## Using an array as arguments


Since the spread operator “spreads” an array into different arguments, any functions that accepts multiple any number of arguments can benefit from use of the spread operator.
