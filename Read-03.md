### Types of list in html
1.Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

2.Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

3.Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along

* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.


# Css
## Boxes
### Box Dimensions
1.width : min-width, max-width

2.height: min-height, max-height

## Border, Margin & Padding
1.Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

2.Margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

3.Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

* there are three main properities for border

   1.border-style

   2.border-color

   3.border width


 * CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

## USING QUOTES INSIDE A STRING
Sometimes you will want to use
a double or single quote mark
within a string.
Because strings can live in single
or double quotes, if you just
want to use double quotes in the
string, you could surround the
entire string in single quotes.
If you just want to use single
quotes in the string, you could
surround the string in double
quotes (as shown in the third line
of this code example).
You can also use a technique
called escaping the quotation
characters. This is done by
using a backwards slash (or
"backslash") before any type of
quote mark that appears within
a string (as shown on the fourth
line of this code sample).
The backwards slash tells the
interpreter that the following
character is part of the string,
rather than the end of it.

## USING A VARIABLE TO STORE A BOOLEAN
A Boolean variable can only have
a va lue of true or fa 1 se, but this
data type is very helpful.
In the example on the right, the
values true or fa 1 se are used
in the cl ass attributes of HTML
elements. These values trigger
different CSS class rules: true
shows a check, fa 1 se shows a
cross. (You learn how the class
attribute is set in Chapter 5.)
It is rare that you would want to
write the words true or false
into the page for the user to read,
but this data type does have two
very popular uses:
First, Booleans are used when
the value can only be true/
fa 1 se. You could also think of
these values as on/off or 0/1:
true is equivalent to on or 1,
fa 1 se is equivalent to off or 0
Second, Booleans are used when
your code can take more than
one path. Remember, different
code may run in different
circumstances

## SHORTHAND FOR CREATING VARIABLES
Programmers sometimes use
shorthand to create variables.
Here are three variations of how
to declare variables and assign
them values:
1. Variables are declared and
values assigned in the same
statement.
2. Three variables are declared
on the same line, then values
assigned to each.
3. Two variables are declared
and assigned values on the same
line. Then one is declared and
assigned a value on the next line.
