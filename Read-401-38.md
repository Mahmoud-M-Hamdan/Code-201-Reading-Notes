## Redux Fundamentals: Async Logic and Data Fetching

### Redux Middleware and Side Effects​

By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

Earlier, we said that Redux reducers must never contain "side effects". A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

* Logging a value to the console
* Saving a file
* Setting an async timer
* Making an AJAX HTTP request
* Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
* Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())


**Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.**

As we said in Part 4, a Redux middleware can do anything when it sees a dispatched action: log something, modify the action, delay the action, make an async call, and more. Also, since middleware form a pipeline around the real store.dispatch function, this also means that we could actually pass something that isn't a plain action object to dispatch, as long as a middleware intercepts that value and doesn't let it reach the reducers.

Middleware also have access to dispatch and getState. That means you could write some async logic in a middleware, and still have the ability to interact with the Redux store by dispatching actions.

### Redux Async Data Flow​

So how do middleware and async logic affect the overall data flow of a Redux app?

Just like with a normal action, we first need to handle a user event in the application, such as a click on a button. Then, we call dispatch(), and pass in something, whether it be a plain action object, a function, or some other value that a middleware can look for.

Once that dispatched value reaches a middleware, it can make an async call, and then dispatch a real action object when the async call completes.

Earlier, we saw a diagram that represents the normal synchronous Redux data flow. When we add async logic to a Redux app, we add an extra step where middleware can run logic like AJAX requests, then dispatch actions. That makes the async data flow look like this:

## Review, Research, and Discussion


### How granular should your reducers be?
It’s easy to go full-warp with very specific events, dedicated for every change that occurs when a user is editing forms such as CHANGE_NAME, CHANGE_STREET, CHANGE_AGE, etc… But it is not actually necessary if the logic behind the update is not different for all those fields. For those parts which require different handling in various reducers; dedicated action is the best solution. For others, sometimes a general action might be good enough.

### Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
Whether this is good or bad depends on your app. having many stores (or Redux reducers) handling the same action is actually very convenient because it divides responsibilities, and also lets people work on feature branches without colliding with the rest of the team. In my experience it's easier to maintain unrelated mutations separately than one giant mutation. But there are cases where this doesn't work too well. I'd say they are often symptoms of a suboptimal state model. For example, in some cases, one reducer may depend on data from another(like moving a message from unread to message, or even promote a message as a new thread from message to thread) is a symptom of a problem. If you have to move stuff inside your state a lot, maybe the state shape needs to be more normalized.

### Name a strategy for preventing the above

Use explicit names for each action to prevent unintended firing (i.e. don’t use ‘RESET’ for every reducer… unless you want them all to reset at the same time

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


Term	
**store:** js plugin is a function that returns an object that gets added to the store. If any of the plugin functions overrides existing functions, the plugin function can still call the original function using the first argument (super_fn).


**combined reducers:**	Combine reducers takes a hash of reducers and returns a reducer. The resulting reducer represents an object of the same shape as the hash. So, a call like this: combineReducers({ name: nameReducer}) Would produce a state object that might look something like this: { name: ‘Joe Shmo’ }
