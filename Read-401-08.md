## Review, Research, and Discussion


### What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization

The WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate response headers define the authentication method that should be used to gain access to a resource. They must specify which authentication scheme is used, so that the client that wishes to authorize knows how to provide the credentials.

### What is safe to put into a JWT

Only the server should know the "secret" that is used to generate the JWT. If someone modifies the data contained in the JWT, the server will fail to decode it. So the server can trust any JWT that it can decode

### How are JWTs validated

1.Retrieve and parse your Okta JSON Web Keys (JWK), which should be checked periodically and cached by your application.
2.Decode the access token, which is in JSON Web Token format.
3.Verify the signature used to sign the access token.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term**

**RBAC**


Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC ensures employees access only information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

**User Roles**

User Roles are permission sets that control access to areas and features within the Professional Archive Platform. Each User account requires a Role assignment.

**JWT Token**


JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON encoded representation of a claim(s) that can be transferred between two parties. The claim is digitally signed by the issuer of the token, and the party receiving this token can later use this digital signature to prove the ownership on the claim.
