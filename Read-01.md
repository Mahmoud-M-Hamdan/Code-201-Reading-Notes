#### HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
**The HyperText Markup Language**, or *HTML* is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
CSS is a style sheet language that’s focused almost entirely on improving the presentation of HTML elements. While CSS is a static programming language, it can be used to make your website appear visually pleasing and modern. If you want your website to have a sleek and stylish design, CSS is the programming language to use. With a basic understanding of CSS, you can make changes to the overall look and feel of your website, which is useful when you want to match the appearance of your website with the aesthetics of your brand.
* Design and Build Websites
* HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

* Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

* Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
* HTML pages are text documents.
*  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
 Attributes require a name and a value.
*  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

#### If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:*
`<!-- comment goes here -->`
````
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.

*  The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

*  The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
*  The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
*  Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
*  The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
````
It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

 Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

 Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

 You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

 You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

### What is CSS?

CSS is a ***style sheet language*** that’s focused almost entirely on improving the *presentation of HTML elements*. While CSS is a static programming language, it can be used to make your website appear visually pleasing and modern. If you want your website to have a sleek and stylish design, CSS is the programming language to use. With a basic understanding of CSS, you can make changes to the overall look and feel of your website, which is useful when you want to match the appearance of your website with the aesthetics of your brand.
#### What Can You Do With CSS?




Even though **CSS** is primarily used to create*static visual effects*, the latest versions of the programming language offer some functionality for the creation of very simple animations.

If you want to change the color of some of the text on a web page, basic CSS would allow you to do so by adding “style” code to the HTML code that’s already found on your page.
Along with the presentation of HTML, CSS can also be used to alter the layout and formatting of your website.
Once you know the basics of CSS, you should be capable of improving the look of your website and all of the HTML that you have already added to the design.

### What is JavaScript?


JavaScript is among ***the most important programming languages for website owners who want to make their site more interactive***, which makes this the most complex of the three standard programming languages in this article. While HTML provides the structure for a website and CSS allows you to control the presentation of a site, the JavaScript programming language gives you the tools that you need to alter the behavior of different elements that are found on a website page. With this tool, you can add a layer of interactivity to the CSS and HTML elements on your website, which is highly recommended if you want your website to appeal to the modern customer.

Most modern websites come with a menu button that can be clicked to display a selection of areas on the website that you can navigate to. The menu button usually reveals a small menu on the side of the page, which adds interactivity to the page itself. All of this is powered by JavaScript and can make your website appear to be more modern and sophisticated.

With a basic understanding of JavaScript, you can manipulate the various interactive features of your website to perform a wide range of actions. If you want to have complete control over the design and function of your website, you should know at least some of the coding involved with JavaScript.

What Can You Do With HTML?
The types of things that you can do with JavaScript are practically limitless. This programming language can provide you with the tools needed to:

Create a calculator for your website
Create various keyboard shortcuts that allow users to effortlessly navigate to other pages
Play animations when users scroll down the page
Since you can change your HTML and CSS elements with JavaScript, this can be a very beneficial language to learn.

* A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.
````
1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP

Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
````
*Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.

*Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer

*solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
