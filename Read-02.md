# Html
### There are many types of tags tags (known as markup) and here we will talk about two types of it

1.Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
  1. Headings:
  HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
h1 is used for main headings
h2 is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
h3 element is used, and so
on...
  2.Paragraphs:
  To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.

2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.
   1. strong:The use of the strong
element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
For example, the words
contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis.
By default, browsers will show
the contents of a strong
element in bold.
   2. em:The em  element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show
the contents of an em element
in italic.

### CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements


CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

This rule indicates that all P
elements should be shown in the
Arial typeface.

Selectors indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.

Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.

### CSS Properties Affect How El ements Are Displayed
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Java Script
A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a ***statement***.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in *variables*.

## DATA TYPES
1.NUMERIC DATA TYPE

The numeric data type handles
numbers.
0.75
For tasks that involve counting
or calculating sums, you will
use numbers 0-9. For example,
five thousand, two hundred and
seventy-two would be written
5272 (note there is no comma
between the thousands and
the hundreds). You can also
have negative numbers (such
as -23678) and decimals (three
quarters is written as 0.75).

2. STRING DATA TYPE

The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.
'H.
1 ' Ivy! 1
Note how the string data type is
enclosed within a pair of quotes.
These can be single or double
quotes, but the opening quote
must match the closing quote.
Strings can be used when
working with any kind of text.
They are frequently used to add
new content into a page and they
can contain HTML markup.

3.BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

Boolean data types can have one
of two va lues: true or false.
true
It might seem a little abstract at
first, but the Boolean data type is
actually very helpful.
You can think of it a little like a
light switch - it is either on or off.
As you will see in Chapter 4,
Booleans are helpful when
determining which part of a
script should run.

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

1.The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

2.The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3.You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.
ONLINE EXTRA
View a full list of keywords and
reserved words in JavaScript.

4.All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

5.Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

6.If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).

***ARRAYS*** An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

***OPERATORS*** Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

## Types of operators
1.ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

2.STRING OPERATOR

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
* strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
