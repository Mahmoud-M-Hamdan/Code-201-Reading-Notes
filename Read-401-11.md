## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

BIDIRECTIONAL. Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange, WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.

2.Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?


Socket.io, and WebSockets in general, require an http server for the initial upgrade handshake. So even if you don't supply Socket.io with an http server it will create one for you.


3.What happens when a client emits an event?

the server will receive that it was emitted and execute the event handler callback.

4.What happens when a server emits an event?

the event will execute the event handler callback.


5.What happens if a client “misses” an event?

it will be ignored

6.How can we mitigate this?

make sure to make events for all of it 


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term**

**Socket** 
 is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network

**Web Socket**


WebSocket is a communications protocol for a persistent, bi-directional, full duplex TCP connection from a user's web browser to a server

**Socket.io**

is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

**Client**


Client-server denotes a relationship between cooperating programs in an application, composed of clients initiating requests for services and servers providing that function or service.

**Server**

 is a physical computer dedicated to run services to serve the needs of other computers. Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server, database server, home media server, print server, or web server.

**OSI Model**

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.

**TCP Model**

TCP model defines how devices should transmit data between them and enables communication over networks and large distances. The model represents how data is exchanged and organized over networks.

**TCP**

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.

**UDP**

User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.
