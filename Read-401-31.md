## Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### When to Use Context

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 

### Before You Use Context

Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.


## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()



* useState():
JavaScript primitives as state / business logic within your component/different properties that don't change in any correlated way and can be 

* useReducer():
JavaScript objects or arrays as state/ complex state transitions /complicated business logic more suitable for a reducer function



2.Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

3.What do custom hooks usually do?

Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.


4.Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

Put the fetchData function above in the useEffect hook and call it, like so: useEffect(() => { const url = "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice"; const fetchData = async () => { try { const response = await fetch(url); const json = await response. json(); console. log(json); } catch (error) .

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**reducer :**  it is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state
