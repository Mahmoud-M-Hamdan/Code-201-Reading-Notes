# Introducing JSX

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

## Why JSX?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.




## Review, Research, and Discussion


### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

Angular.js
Embre.js
Meteor.js
Backbone.js
Vue.js

### What’s the difference between a framework and a library?


A library performs specific, well-defined operations.

A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

Examples of libraries: Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained.

Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Rendering:** turning website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website

**Templates:** it is a pre designed resource that shows the structure for the comprehensive layout and display features of any website

**State:** it is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.
