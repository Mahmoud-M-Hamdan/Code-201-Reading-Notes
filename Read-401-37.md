## Review, Research, and Discussion


### 1.Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

Context API is easy to is use as it has a short learning curve. It requires less code, and because there's no need of extra libraries, bundle sizes are reduced. Redux on the other hand requires adding more libraries to the application bundle. The syntax is complex and extensive creating unnecessary work and complexity

### 2.What is the purpose of a reducer?

A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

### 3.What does an action contain?

Redux data flow. Actions: Actions are a plain JavaScript object that contains information. Actions are the only source of information for the store. Actions have a type field that tells what kind of action to perform and all other fields contain information or data.

### 4.Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**immutable state :** means its value cannot be changed once it's created. ... A mutable state allows us to modify already created data structures and change them whichever way we want.

**time travel in redux** The Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time. This makes it possible to inspect the state and travel back in time to a previous application state without reloading the page or restarting the app.

**action creator**	An action creator is merely a function that returns an action object. Redux includes a utility function called bindActionCreators for binding one or more action creators to the store’s dispatch() function.

**reducer** 
	reducer is a very simple idea and it’s something that will be easy for you to grasp because, in a nutshell, it’s just a simple JS function. A reducer is a function which takes two arguments — the current state and an action — and returns based on both arguments a new state

**dispatch** dispatch is a function of the Redux store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for you.
