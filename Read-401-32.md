## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

Both Ways Can used In class components, the render method will be called, whenever the state of the components changes. On the other hand, the Functional components render the UI based on the props. Class Components should be preferred whenever we have the requirement with the state of the component.


2.What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?


Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

3.How can you best test context?

 make our tests unaware of its existence and avoiding mocks


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
**Term
**context :**

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component: class App extends React.

**useContext() :**
useContext hook allows passing data to children elements without using redux. useContext hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level. Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.


**static context :**

This rule applies when the static contextType property of a React component is not properly specified. The contextType property is used to consume a context created with React. ... When the property is specified for a React component, you can access the current value of the context using this.
