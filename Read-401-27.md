## Making Sense of React Hooks

## Why Hooks?
We know that components and top-down data flow help us organize a large UI into small, independent, reusable pieces. However, we often can’t break complex components down any further because the logic is stateful and can’t be extracted to a function or another component. Sometimes that’s what people mean when they say React doesn’t let them “separate concerns.”


These cases are very common and include animations, form handling, connecting to external data sources, and many other things we want to do from our components. When we try to solve these use cases with components alone, we usually end up with:

* Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
* Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
* Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

## Do Hooks Make React Bloated?


Before we look at Hooks in detail, you might be worried that we’re just adding more concepts to React with Hooks. That’s a fair criticism. I think that while there is definitely going to be a short-term cognitive cost to learning them, the end result will be the opposite.
If the React community embraces the Hooks proposal, it will reduce the number of concepts you need to juggle when writing React applications. Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.
In terms of the implementation size, the Hooks support increases React only by ~1.5kB (min+gzip). While this isn’t much, it’s also likely that adopting Hooks could reduce your bundle size because code using Hooks tends to minify better than equivalent code using classes

## What Are Hooks, Exactly?

To understand Hooks, we need to take a step back and think about code reuse.
Today, there are a lot of ways to reuse logic in React apps. We can write simple functions and call them to calculate something. We can also write components (which themselves could be functions or classes). Components are more powerful, but they have to render some UI. This makes them inconvenient for sharing non-visual logic. This is how we end up with complex patterns like render props and higher-order components. Wouldn’t React be simpler if there was just one common way to reuse code instead of so many?
Functions seem to be a perfect mechanism for code reuse. Moving logic between functions takes the least amount of effort. However, functions can’t have local React state inside them. You can’t extract behavior like “watch window size and update the state” or “animate a value over time” from a class component without restructuring your code or introducing an abstraction like Observables. Both approaches hurt the simplicity that we like about React.
Hooks solve exactly that problem. Hooks let you use React features (like state) from a function — by doing a single function call. React provides a few built-in Hooks exposing the “building blocks” of React: state, lifecycle, and context.
Since Hooks are regular JavaScript functions, you can combine built-in Hooks provided by React into your own “custom Hooks”

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript. React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.

Event handling in HTML and React are different from one another in terms of syntax and some rules. The reason behind this is that React works on the concept of virtual DOM, on the other hand, the HTML has access to the Real DOM all the time.


2.What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term**
**Functional Components :** 
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
**Children / Child Components :** 
Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. ... The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children
