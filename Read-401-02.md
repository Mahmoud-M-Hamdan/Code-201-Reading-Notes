### What is PUT?

PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely. PUT is similar to POST in that it can create resources, but it does so when there is a defined URI. PUT overwrites the entire entity if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it doesn’t exist.

For example, when you want to change the first name of a person in a database, you need to send the entire resource when making a PUT request.
````
{“first": "John", "last": "Stone”}
````

To make a PUT request, you need to send the two parameters; the first and the last name.

### What is PATCH?

Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.

This means that you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won’t affect or change anything else. So if you want to update the first name on a database, you will only be required to send the first parameter; the first name.

### APIdoc vs Swagger for node app

* Popularity: By comparing stats,  swagger-ui is more popular then apidocjs.

* Consistency: If we already using swagger for our Dotnetcore service, then implementing swagger tool will consist more from Info and UI prospective.

* Implementation complexity: apidocjs and swagger both required documentation content on implemented method as customize comment data. In addition they allow to write documentation data in separate resource file as .js and json. If we already have swagger.json created by DotnetCore we can reuse more than 80% specification.

* Maintenance: For apidocjs will have to modify documentation for each affected method/endpoints if service changed. In swagger we can limit changes. But by implementing apidocjs we can isolate the layer. 

* Other benefits: Because swagger use plain .json that could be parsed through programing language, thus we can get advantage of various other 3rd parties in order to create http client and more. 

* Future: Due to popularity of swagger, apidocjs provide information about apidoc-swagger converter so we can switch apidoc to swagger anytime.

### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

1.SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style

2.SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider, whereas REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data

3.SOAP invokes services by calling RPC method, REST just simply calls services via URL path

4.SOAP doesn't return human readable result, whilst REST result is readable with is just plain XML or JSON

5.SOAP is not just over HTTP, it also uses other protocols such as SMTP, FTP, etc, REST is over only HTTP
