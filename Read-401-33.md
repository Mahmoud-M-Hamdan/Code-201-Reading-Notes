## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.Why is the Context API useful?

The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

2.Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

React context gets injected into the component render stack. ... It's a state management which u can use over your whole react app. U can also access the state outside of react (if necessary) and it has a connector to react (react-redux).

3.What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

Theming — Pass down app theme.
- Pass down translation messages.
Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user.

4.Describe “Context Hell”

Without useContext, you may need to pass or drilling props to each components in the app to be access for the components that will consume it.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
**Term**
**global state :**
is a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other. ... A global state in the time domain is also a global state in the causal domain; if two states occur simultaneously, then they cannot have any cause-effect relationship.

**global context:**

This is context that affects the entire application, and it will share data to everything in the React component tree.


**provider:**
The component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected to the store, most applications will render a at the top level, with the entire app's component tree inside of it.

**consumer:**


The Consumer component allows a React component to subscribe to the context changes. The component makes the data available using a render prop
