## Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

Most developers are introduced to concepts of Event-Driven Programming early on in their study of programming yet they might not fully realize it until a bit later. You’ll find that the concept is rather ubiquitous. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you’ll find evidence of Event-Driven Programming.

## Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

* An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
* A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

## EventEmitter

Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

Those are both worth checking out if your project needs to run faster than EventEmitter will allow. They are both built to allow for syntax that is almost identical to what we’ll use for EventEmitter so learning one will make it easy to work with all of them.

We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.


## Removing Listeners

There will likely come a time when you want to remove an event listener from an event. This could be for performance reasons (the event is no longer needed) or to avoid memory leaks (if an event listener references an object that is no longer needed, it won’t be able to be garbage-collected. This can lead to a build up of unnecessary objects).

To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method. It’s important to note that in the EventEmitter that comes built-in with Node you must pass a reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method. This means wherever you wish to remove the event, you’ll need to make sure the function is able to be referenced from that place in your code. For this reason it is often best to name your event handling functions and declaring them before you register the event listener, as opposed to leaving them anonymous.

In the following example, it would be a challenge to remove the listener for the message event from outside of the userJoined function due to the fact that it’s an anonymous function declared within a closure. In this case the only place we would be able to directly reference this method would be in the EventEmitter Object itself. This would be impractical if we ever had more than one listener registered to a single event as we would then have to figure out a way to decipher which of the listeners is our intended target.



## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.Why is access control important?


Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.


2.Describe an application that would need access control.

security systems in our doors, key locks, fences, biometric systems

3.What is a role used for?


A role is a collection of privileges that can be granted to one or more users or other roles. Roles help you grant and manage sets of privileges for various categories of users, rather than grant those privileges to each user individually. For example, several users might require administrative privileges.


4.Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

RBAC is more scalable because it helps reducing the reduce administration complexity and the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role is reduced.

Vocabulary Terms

**Authorization** - a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources based on the user's identity.

**Role Based Access Control** - an approach of restricting system access to authorized users based on their role in an organization.

**Capabilities**- permission sets that control access to areas and features within the server.
