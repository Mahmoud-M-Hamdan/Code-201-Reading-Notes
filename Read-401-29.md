## useReducer

An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

## How does useReducer work?
useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.

useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function, to which you can pass an action and later invoke. This is similar to the pattern Redux uses but with a few differences.

For example, the useReducer function is tightly coupled to a specific reducer. We dispatch action objects to that reducer only, whereas in Redux, the dispatch function sends the action object to the store. At the time of dispatch, the components don’t need to know the reducer that will process the action.

For those who may be unfamiliar with Redux, we’ll explore this concept a bit further. There are three main building blocks in Redux:

* A store — an immutable object that holds the applications state data
* A reducer — a function that returns some state data, triggered by an action type
* An action — an object that tells the reducer how to change the state. It must contain a type property, and it can contain an optional payload property.


 ## The dispatch method


The dispatch function accepts an object that represents the type of action we want to execute when it is called. It basically sends the type of action to the reducer function to perform its job, which, of course, is updating the state.

The action to be executed is specified in our reducer function, which in turn is passed to the useReducer. The reducer function will then return the updated state.

The actions that will be dispatched by our components should always be represented as one object with the type and payload key, where type stands as the identifier of the dispatched action and payload is the piece of information that this action will add to the state.

The dispatch is the second value returned from the useReducer Hook and can be used in our JSX to update the state.

## Review, Research, and Discussion



### How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?


If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ( [] ) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn't depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

### Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

To update the component's state invoke the updater function setState(newState) with the new state. The component re-renders and state receives the new value newState.,Invoking the state updater function setState(newState) with the new value updates the state.



### Is useState() synchronous?


useState both are asynchronous.,They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term**
**State Hook :** A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We'll learn other Hooks later.


**Component Lifecycle :**

Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle. There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component’s life.At present, we know what lifecycle methods are and why they are important.
