* **Brute Force attack:** Hashes can't be reversed, so instead of reversing the hash of the password, an attacker can simply keep trying different inputs until he does not find the right now that generates the same hash value, called brute force attack.

General-purpose hash function designed for speed,because they are often used to calculate checksum values for large data sets and files, to check for data integrity. Using a modern computer one can crack a 16 Character Strong password in less than an hour, thanks to GPU.

* **Hash Collision attack**: Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash. MD5, SHA1, SHA2 are vulnerable to Hash Collision Attack i.e. two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result.

Salting your password may foil dictionary attacks, but an attacker can still use a wordlist to crack the hashes. So, what exactly could be a good for securing your passwords with hashing?

* **BCrypt**, IT's SLOW AND STRONG AS HELL
To overcome such issues, we need algorithms which can make the brute force attacks slower and minimize the impact. Such algorithms are PBKDF2 and BCrypt, both of these algorithms use a technique called Key Stretching.


# Authentication

* **Authentication** is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

* **Session Management** is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict. The Session Management Cheat Sheet contains further guidance on the best practices in this area.


## Authentication General Guidelines¶

### User IDs¶

* Make sure your usernames/user IDs are case-insensitive. User 'smith' and user 'Smith' should be the same user. Usernames should also be unique. For high-security applications, usernames could be assigned and secret instead of user-defined public data.

* Email address as a User ID¶
For information on validating email addresses, please visit the input validation cheatsheet email discussion.

## Authentication Solution and Sensitive Accounts¶
* Do NOT allow login with sensitive accounts (i.e. accounts that can be used internally within the solution such as to a back-end / middle-ware / DB) to any front-end user-interface
* Do NOT use the same authentication solution (e.g. IDP / AD) used internally for unsecured access (e.g. public access / DMZ)



## Review, Research, and Discussion



### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object. This is helpful usually when a single object is required to coordinate actions across a system.

The singleton pattern is used in programming languages such as Java and .NET to define a global variable. A single object used across systems remains constant and needs to be defined only once rather than many times.






## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
**Term**

**Router Middleware :**
The term is composed of 2 words router and middleware. Middleware. It is a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response . It kind of hijacks your request so that you can do anything that you want with your request or response eg: Modify the data or call the next middleware

**Dynamic Module Loading :**
a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory

**Singleton Pattern :**
an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and in this way one can ensure that they don’t accidentally create, say, two Users in a single User application

**CRUD -> REST Method Matches :**
create, read, update and delete.

**Mock Testing :**
Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behaviour or state of external dependencies.
