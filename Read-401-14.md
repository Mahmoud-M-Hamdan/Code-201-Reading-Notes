## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe “The Cloud”

The Cloud is a generic term for remotely accessed storage. This storage is accessed through the internet. Users do not actually know where their data is stored - the geographical location is unimportant. Users only need to know that their data is stored on a server connected to the internet.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

### What is auto-scaling?

It is the process of monitoring your applications and automatically adjusting capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
It is a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating computational resources. Depending on the load to a server farm or pool, the number of servers that are active will typically vary automatically as user needs fluctuate.
Auto scaling and load balancing are related because an application typically scales based on load balancing serving capacity.

###  What is bandwidth?

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it’s actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

## Vocabulary Terms


**Server Instances**
A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based

**Containers**
Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop

**Cloud Services**
Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.

Cloud services facilitate the flow of user data from front-end clients (e.g. users’ servers, tablets, desktops, laptops—anything on the users’ ends), through the internet, to the provider’s systems, and back. Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity or virtual private network (VPN).


**Cloud Architecture:**
 The technology components that are combined to build a cloud.

**AWS:**
 Amazon Web Service.

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:**

 Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.
