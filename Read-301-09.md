# What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## Pure functions

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments
Imagine we want to implement a function that calculates the area of a circle. An impure function would receive radius as the parameter, and then calculate radius * radius * PI:

## Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
* Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
* Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

## Immutability

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## Filter

Given a collection, we want to filter by an attribute. The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. Basically, if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.
* A simple example is when we have a collection of integers and we want only the even numbers.

## Map
The idea of map is to transform a collection.
The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

## Reduce

The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
A common example people talk about is to get the total amount of an order. Imagine you were at a shopping website. You’ve added Product 1, Product 2, Product 3, and Product 4 to your shopping cart (order). Now we want to calculate the total amount of the shopping cart.
In imperative way, we would iterate the order list and sum each product amount to the total amount.
