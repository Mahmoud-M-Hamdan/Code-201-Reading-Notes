### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, local storage can only be read by the client-side. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or the server?

If it's your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch. You're wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header.

If it's your server, local storage isn't so useful because you'd have to forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something). This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data for each request.

### Explain 3rd party cookies.

Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.



### How do pixel tags work?
A tracking pixel is a 1×1 pixel graphic that tracks web traffic, site conversions, user behavior, and more on at a site's server level. This enables ecommerce store owners to gain a deep understanding of how users interact and respond to their ads, their email campaigns, and their site as a whole.
