## Review, Research, and Discussion


1.Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).


2.Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

It is the side that receive a request for some kind of information from the client, then responses back to the client.


3.What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

It means to store the application in place that will make it usable by anyone, not just by the developer on the local machine.
