## SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

* SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

* SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

* For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

* For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

* For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

* For high transactional based application: SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. While you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.

* For support: Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors. There are also lot of independent consultations who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments. For some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support, and only limited outside experts are available for you to setup and deploy your large scale NoSQL deployments.

* For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )

* For DB types: On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors. NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

## Data Modeling – Table Elements

* The Table Name, which is located at the top of the table.

* The Primary Keys.  Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more.  When the key has more than one column, it is called a compound key.

* Table Columns – There can be one or more table columns.  To keep the diagrams simple, I don’t show the data types.  I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.

* Foreign Key – This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Better program design and higher code quality
2. Detailed project documentation
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

 before each test and resetting after each test so make the code between them 



## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

 The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.
The development of the code is slow


## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?


 * ES6 class constructors creates objects by adding function to their prototypes (Blueprint), in	ES5 function constructors also create objects along with inheritance property. 


* in ES6 It ensures that this keyword used by the developer is referring to the object being created by the developer but in ES5 Any function can be used as a function constructor and it primarily focuses on the creation of reusable object creation code.

* in ES6 Its syntax is similar to object creation in other object-oriented programming languages. and in ES5 Its syntax is unique and is not generally found in other object-oriented programming languages.


## Why REST?

provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia


## Vocabulary Terms:

**functional programming :** the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

**object-oriented programming (OOP) :** A programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

**class :** Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

**Test Driven Development (TDD) :** Before you write implementation code, write some code that proves that the implementation works or fails

**Jest :** is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

**Continuous Integration (CI) :** is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

**REST :** is an architectural style that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and scalability.

**Data Model :** is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
