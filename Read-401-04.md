## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Better program design and higher code quality
2. Detailed project documentation
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

 before each test and resetting after each test so make the code between them 



## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

 The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.
The development of the code is slow


## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?


 * ES6 class constructors creates objects by adding function to their prototypes (Blueprint), in	ES5 function constructors also create objects along with inheritance property. 


* in ES6 It ensures that this keyword used by the developer is referring to the object being created by the developer but in ES5 Any function can be used as a function constructor and it primarily focuses on the creation of reusable object creation code.

* in ES6 Its syntax is similar to object creation in other object-oriented programming languages. and in ES5 Its syntax is unique and is not generally found in other object-oriented programming languages.


## Why REST?

provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia


## Vocabulary Terms:

**functional programming :** the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

**object-oriented programming (OOP) :** A programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

**class :** Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

**Test Driven Development (TDD) :** Before you write implementation code, write some code that proves that the implementation works or fails

**Jest :** is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

**Continuous Integration (CI) :** is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

**REST :** is an architectural style that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and scalability.

**Data Model :** is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
