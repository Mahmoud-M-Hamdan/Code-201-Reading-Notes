## Using the Effect Hook

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Effects Without Cleanup

Sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don’t require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let’s compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects.


## What does useEffect do?

 By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

## Why is useEffect called inside a component? 

Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.

## Does useEffect run after every render?

 Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.) Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.



## Review, Research, and Discussion
In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

create-react-app provides a great starting point to start a new react app fully configured with webpack, live reloading, etc. But, sadly, it doesn’t provide a way to provide different index files with a different set of entry points.




### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

renders the appropriate user interface when the current location matches the route’s path.
The component prop defines the React element that will be returned by the Route when the path is matched. This React element is created from the provided component using React.createElement.

### What does props.children contain?

props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. This component contains an  that is receiving some props and then it is displaying {props.






## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
**Term**
**State Hook :**
A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later

**Mounting and Un-Mounting :**
Mounting a file system attaches that file system to a directory (mount point) and makes it available to the system.The root ( / ) file system is always mounted. Any other file system can be connected or disconnected from the root ( / ) file system
