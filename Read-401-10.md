## Socket.IO

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts − a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for node.js. Both components have an identical API.

## Real-time Applications

A real-time application (RTA) is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as immediate or current.

Some examples of real-time applications are −

* Instant messengers − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.

* Push Notifications − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly.

* Collaboration Applications − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances.

* Online Gaming − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.



## Why Socket.IO?

Writing a real-time application with popular web applications stacks like LAMP (PHP) has traditionally been very hard. It involves polling the server for changes, keeping track of timestamps, and it is a lot slower than it should be.

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever an event occurs, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to the concerned connected clients.

Socket.IO is quite popular, it is used by Microsoft Office, Yammer, Zendesk, Trello,. and numerous other organizations to build robust real-time systems. It one of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks on GitHub, and most depended-upon NPM (Node Package Manager) module. Socket.IO also has a huge community, which means finding help is quite easy.


## Difference Between WebSocket and Socket.io

* WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.

* Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. Generally, it is divided into two parts; both WebSocket vs Socket.io are event-driven libraries.



## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication.


2.UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

UDP is a connectionless protocol. No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself.

3.Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

A socket that has been established as a server can accept connection requests from multiple clients.

4.Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?


Yes - you need one socket for each connection. A socket is a client IP address + client port + server IP address + server port combination. If a client is talking to multiple servers, it is using multiple ports on the client machine.


5.Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes, you can , You will have to use threads.
