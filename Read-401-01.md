## what Array.map() does

The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method. Generally map() method is used to iterate over an array and calling function on every element of array.

Syntax:

````
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
````
Parameters: This method accepts two parameters as mentioned above and described below:

**function(currentValue, index, arr):** It is required parameter and it runs on each element of array. It contains three parameters which are listed below:
* currentValue: It is required parameter and it holds the 
value of current element.

* index: It is optional parameter and it holds the index of current element.

* arr: It is optional parameter and it holds the array.

**thisValue:** It is optional parameter and used to hold the value of passed to the function.

**Return Value:** It returns a new array and elements of arrays are result of callback function.

## what Array.reduce() does

The arr.reduce() method in JavaScript is used to reduce the array to a single value and executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right) and the return value of the function is stored in an accumulator.

Syntax:
````
array.reduce( function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), 
initialValue )
````

**Parameter:** This method accepts five parameters as mentioned above and described below:

* function(total, currentValue, index, arr): It is the required parameter and used to run for each element of array. It contains four parameter which are listed below:
total: It is required parameter and used to specify the initialValue, or the previously returned value of the function.
* currentValue: It is required parameter and used to specify the value of the current element.
* currentIndex: It is optional parameter and used to specify the array index of the current element.
* arr: It is optional parameter and used to specify the array object the current element belongs to.
* initialValue: It is optional parameter and used to specify the value to be passed to the function as the initial value.


## Promises

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. 

Prior to promises events and callback functions were used but they had limited functionalities and created unmanageable code. 
Multiple callback functions would create callback hell that leads to unmanageable code. 
Events were not good at handling asynchronous operations.

Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner. They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events.

* Benefits of Promises 

  1.Improves Code Readability

  2.Better handling of asynchronous operations

  3.Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic

  4.Better Error Handling

* A Promise has four states: 

  1. fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded

  2.rejected: Action related to the promise failed

  3.pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet

  4.settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected


A promise can be created using Promise constructor.

Syntax
````
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     //do something
});
````

* Parameters 

  * Promise constructor takes only one argument,a callback function.
  * Callback function takes two arguments, resolve and reject
  * Perform operations inside the callback function and if everything went well then call resolve.
  * If desired operations do not go well then call reject.
