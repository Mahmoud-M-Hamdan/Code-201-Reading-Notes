# RESTful web API design

Most modern web applications expose APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. A well-designed web API should aim to support:

* Platform independence. Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This requires using standard protocols, and having a mechanism whereby the client and the web service can agree on the format of the data to exchange.

* Service evolution. The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. As the API evolves, existing client applications should continue to function without modification. All functionality should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it.

## What is REST?

In 2000, Roy Fielding proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services. REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

A primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards, and does not bind the implementation of the API or the client applications to any specific implementation. For example, a REST web service could be written in ASP.NET, and client applications can use any language or toolset that can generate HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses.

* REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

* A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource.

## Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods

* **GET** retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
* **POST** creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
* **PUT** either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
* **PATCH** performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
* **DELETE** removes the resource at the specified URI.
